The objective of the assignment is to build a program that reads Scottish census population and SIMD data and
performs a simple analysis with respect to the multi-mode electoral ward regions. The input data files can be
found on the repository as 'DC...' and 'SIMD...'. These files have been downloaded from the Scottish census and SIMD web sites.
The census data file has been modified slightly, such that it is easier to read it with a Python program.

This program was completed in October 2022, and uploaded to github in November 2023.

To run the program, simply download all available files, open the files with your favorite python IDE, and run it.
